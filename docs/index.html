  <b>Running this project involved the following steps:</b>

  1. Locally:
  - Initially, I cloned the GitHub repository to my computer using the command: `git clone
  https://github.com/aruvham/javascript-ray-casting.git`.
  - Since the project was built on express.js, a node.js framework, I installed node.js on my computer and executed the
  following commands in the command line to start the project:
  - `cd javascript-ray-casting`
  - `node index.js`
  - This initiated a server for the project on Localhost port 3000. To view the project's output, I had to visit
  http://localhost:3000 in my browser.

  2. Remotely on This Page:
  - The project utilized the P5.js library to implement ray casting using JavaScript.
  - The resulting JavaScript code was injected into the body of the index.html file, allowing the project to run
  seamlessly on any JavaScript-supported browser.

  Interacting with the project involved the use of arrow keys:
  - The Left and Right arrows altered the direction of the cast rays.
  - The Top and Down arrows moved the source of the rays forward and backward.
